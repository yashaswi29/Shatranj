I have been playing chess since primary school and one day I had an idea to implement chess in Python.

In this Python project, I designed and implemented a dynamic Chess Game with a 2-way playing mode, allowing players to engage in captivating matches on a single machine. The game features well-defined chess piece movements, accurately adhering to the rules of the classic chessboard. 

To provide a user-friendly interface, I utilized the Pygame library, enabling smooth and visually appealing interactions between players and the game board. With a focus on user experience and gameplay, this Chess Game delivers an immersive and challenging experience, ideal for both chess enthusiasts and casual players alike. 

The combination of Python programming and Pygame graphics results in a compelling project that showcases my proficiency in game development and creativity in implementing classic board games in a digital environment.

Utilize a greedy algorithm that prioritizes immediate gains, capturing pieces or controlling central squares. Implement a random move AI for a casual playing experience. Introduce a simple minimax algorithm for more strategic decision-making, choosing moves that benefit you and limit your opponent's options.
